Auto generates gfycat videos from gifs in the media library.

Adds gfycat into to the media object as 'gfycat_code' for the unique id to check status on gfycat or, more importantly, `gfycat_name` which gifves you the ids for embedding.

You still have to do your own embedding in your template at this stage.
